Die, fool!
The night beckons!
Your soul is mine!
I hunger!
Death rages!
Die!
Insufferable lout...
I have better things to do...
I must feed.
Your life will sustain me.
You think you can match the might of a Dreadlord?
Wake up, time to die.
None can oppose me.
This one is mine.
Vanquish the weak!
For the Nathrezim!
I'll cut out your tongue!
My power is supreme!
You will all drown in lakes of blood!
Feel the wrath of the Legion!
Miserable insect!
Your time has come to an end.
Your death will be in vain, mortal.
Scream for me.
Pity, no time for a slow death.
Your hopes are lost.

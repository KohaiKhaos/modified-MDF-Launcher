Your fear drives me.
Your suffering strengthens me.
Your agony sustains me.
Your hatred empowers me.
You are weak.
Your heart will explode.
You will die.
Your courage will fail.
Your friends will abandon you.
You will betray your friends.
You are already dead.
Death is close...
The darkest days are still ahead.
Your soul will know endless torment.
Our numbers are endless.
Hear the call. Serve them. Join us.
They drink your fear: it is the blood of life.
They are the whisper on the shivering wind.
They who dine on lost souls know only hunger.
Gaze into the void. It is the perpetuity in which they dwell.
This form means nothing. We are without end.
There is no escape. Not in this life, not in the next.
You are a pawn of forces unseen.
It WAS your fault.
They are coming for you.
Kill them all before they kill you.
They have turned against you. Now, take your revenge.
Tell yourself again that these are not truly your friends.
Give in to your fear.
All that you know will fade.
You will be alone in the end.
Trust is your weakness.
Hope is an illusion.
You resist. You cling to your life as if it actually matters. You will learn.
Eternal suffering awaits.
*Multiple, familiar voices fill your head. They laugh insanely without pause...*
*Constant screams of multiple people fill your head. Their voices sound familiar...*
*A comforting whisper fills your head* This is all just a dream. You will wake up soon...
*The voices of your long-dead relatives fill your head. You can't make out what they're saying, but you know they are all insulting and mocking you..*

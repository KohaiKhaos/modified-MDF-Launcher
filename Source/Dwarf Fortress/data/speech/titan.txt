whose magic couldn't best my skill
who was an insult to real gods
whom I beheld as [PRO_SUB] fell like lightning
whose hubris sealed [PRO_POS] fate
who the gods punished with me as their tool of retribution
the arrogant fool whose natural strength was no match for my skill
a false god whose mere existance was blasphemous

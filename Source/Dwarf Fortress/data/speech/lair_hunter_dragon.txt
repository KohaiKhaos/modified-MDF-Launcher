Show me your power!
I must feed...slake my hunger!
You cannot win, maggot!
Try it. Attack me!
That's it, show me your power!
'Tis the will of the world...stand against me!
The world calls out for a new ringmaster...
A strange trick of fate...to meet a fellow countryman.
Fight! Cling to life!
Have you come so far to be stricken with cowardice? You have chosen your path!
Pitiable wingless being...return to the earth!
If you were to gain something, give your all here and now! Such is the contest you have chosen!
This is not fate, nor duty's call. This battle is your own, waged of your own free will.
Aye, raise your weapon...Your teeth of steel, your blood-red voice...Show me your power!
Show that you possess the strength to still my heart. The will to do it. The soul!

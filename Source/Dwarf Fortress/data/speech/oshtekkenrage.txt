Die, unbeliever!
Pray for my mercy!
Crawl, salamander!
Little mouse...
You don't impress me.
Taste the blade of Osh-Tekk!
I will drink your blood!
Death comes to all.
Pathetic!
Your sacrifice shall honor me!
You are most worthy to die by my hand!
Death is the warrior's way.
Now you will perish.
Vermin...
You have chosen death!
You cannot hide from your doom!
You strike no fear in me...
I will kill you for sport!
Come at me, little dove!
You spit at me no longer!
Retreat if you wish to live.
I will extract your beating heart!
You do not impress.
Your heart will burn in my hands.
The sky foretold your demise.
The sacred time is near.
I am your executioner!
Accept your fate!

As I shall consume your flesh, so too shall the Legion consume your people!
I will break you!
Finally, something to relieve the tedium.
This is the part I enjoy most...
Sniveling pests!
Pathetic mortal! You will pay dearly!
You have yet to learn the true meaning of agony!
You will pay dearly for your interference, mortal.
Do you fear death?
The Legion will conquer all!
The sky darkens with your impending demise!

The ones from beyond the world are watching!
All mortal lives are forfeit.
The end will come!
The end is nigh!
They will reveal to us new worlds of pleasure and pain!
Cast off your chains.  Revel in your desires!
Crush all who stand before you.
Can you not hear them?
Do not stand against the inevitable!
When the stars are right, THEY will return!
It comes!
The ones who watch from beyond the veil!
Only fools seek to end suffering.
Embrace the inevitable!
Rise up!
The eternal night has begun!
The last sunset has come upon us.
The time of the Dark Prophecy is near!
The chains of society have fallen!
Can you hear their voices?
They whisper to me.
Listen.  You can hear them, can't you?
No mortal can stand against the will of the Old Ones.
Surrender your will to the Dread Lords.
Free the blind ones from their mortal shells.
The Beast rises.
The dead will walk among the living.
Mortal will rise against mortal, and they will revel in their killing.
Join us.  Do not resist your calling!
Surrender your body and soul!
Bow before your true masters!
The voice from the Rift has found its host!
Let the voices in.  Do not resist.

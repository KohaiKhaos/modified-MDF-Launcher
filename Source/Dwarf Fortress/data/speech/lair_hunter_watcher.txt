Who dares awaken [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME]?
Who dares the wrath of the Makers?!
You will suffer for this trespass!
None may steal the secrets of the Makers.
You cannot hide from fate!
It has been ages since I faced a worthy opponent. Let the battle begin!
There is no escape!
You shouldn't have come.
Begone from this sacred place!
I will send you to your deity.
I will take your life as an offering!
Defilers! Wretches! Fiends! Begone from here!
Turn back, intruders!

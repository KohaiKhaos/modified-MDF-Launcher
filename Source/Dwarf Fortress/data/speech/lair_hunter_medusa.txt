Hey there, lovely...Wanna chat?
Don't run away, I just want to talk a bit...
Come hither!
Come to me...I just want to cuddle for a little while.
Mm, look what has accidentally stumbled into my home...Oh, who are we kidding...You WANTED to spend some time with me, right?
Please don't walk away...I've been lonely for so long...
Don't run, darling...You'll love what you'll see.
All I want is to talk with someone again...
Stay with me, sweetheart...We could be happy together, forever...
Sweetie...don't you hide from me...
I love you, honey...Don't go, I don't want to be alone again...

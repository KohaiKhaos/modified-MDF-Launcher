At last, a target for my frustrations!
On guard!
Defend yourself...for all the good it will do...
You fear death? Far worse awaits you, should you fail!
Slay the mortals!
I will strike them down!
None will survive!
With bloody pleasure...
At last!
I charge into the fray!
Hell awaits you!
You will not escape!
Mortal!
Flesh!
I will eat your soul!

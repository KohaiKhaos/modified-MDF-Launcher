Wither away!
Waste of energy!
Your bodies shall feed the bloom. Aren't you thankful?
More fodder for our soil!
I have known weeds that were more threatening than your kind.
Your kind will not defy the will of the ancients.
Your corpse will feed our god!
You will be purged!
The forest closes in around you.
You will never escape...
Trespassers beware!
Your corpse will grow countless of us!
You're nothing more than a weed that must be pulled.
The will of the ancients shall be upheld!
Death to all defilers!
Feel nature's wrath!
Die, infestation of flesh.
You are unwelcome, flesh beast.
Your body shall feed our armies.
Your body will serve us in death.
Your blood shall become sap.

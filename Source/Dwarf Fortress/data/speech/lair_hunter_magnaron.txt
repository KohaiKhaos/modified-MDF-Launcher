You cannot defy the Great Work.
You do not understand our purpose.
Smash you...into mountain.
Our work is vital to the world.
This is the way of things. You cannot stop it.
You do not understand the Great Work.
No escape.
I'll break you.
I'll bury you.
I'll crack you open.
You cannot match my power.
Fear the ground beneath you.
Tremble like the earth.
Flee now.
Run away.

Glory to the Legion!
I will enjoy watching you die.
A welcome diversion.
Your time is running out.
You waste my time.
Death awaits you, mortal!
Do you fear death?
I will break you!
Finally, something to relieve the tedium.
I shall cleave your soul in twain.
I will reap your soul.
We will consume your puny world!
Behold the power of the Legion!
Die!
Suffer!

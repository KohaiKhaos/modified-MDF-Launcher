You put up a good fight...but it's over.
Go ahead, try resisting.
You're done.
Feeling dizzy?...Bye bye!
You're getting weak...Time to die!
Not so tough now, are we?
Can you feel your strength fading?
There, that should do it.
Try not to squirm too much...
Struggling won't help.
Don't make this harder...
Lie down, relax, surrender.
The more you fight, the harder it'll be.
No amount of fighting will save you.
See you on the flipside...
This is going to cost you an arm and a leg.
You'll be my next export...sunshine.
Hohoho, look at you, stumbling around...
Time to sleep...
Embrace it! Surrender to it!

Come...and die.
Beg for life.
No escape.
I will crack your bones one by one.
I will crush you.
I will eat your meat.
I will flay you alive.
Your name is as insignificant to me as the names of the thousands who have died under the might of [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Who dares rouse [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] from [SPEAKER:PRO_POS] restful slumber?
[SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] smell flesh.
Hahahaha, [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] kill you so easy!
[SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] smash!
[SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] crush you NOW!

For the Legion!
Pathetic wretch!
All life will be eradicated!
Your life ends now!
You face the might of the Burning Legion!
Oblivion comes!
Feel the Legion's power!
The universe will be remade.
Contemptible wretch!
I'll rip the flesh from your bones!
All mortals will perish!
The Legion will conquer all!
Cry for mercy! Your meaningless lives will soon be forfeit.
Miserable nuisance!
Your death will be a painful one.
Your insolence will be your death!
You dare stand against me?
I will not be defeated!
Die, weakling!

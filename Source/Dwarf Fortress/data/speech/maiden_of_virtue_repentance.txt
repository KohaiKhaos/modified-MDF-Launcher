Your behavior will not be tolerated.
Cast our your corrupt thoughts.
Impure thoughts lead to profane actions.
The stench of corruption is upon you.
Hold, mortal. Open your heart to virtue.
Renounce your greed and perversion.
Repent...or die!
The strong must suffer for the sins of the weak.
A pure mind is an orderly mind.

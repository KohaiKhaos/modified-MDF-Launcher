Hahaha... Well, that's just too bad, isn't it.
Ha ha ha...Now it's time for my other favorite game.  I call it, 'Cat and Mouse'.  I'm the cat.  You're the mouse.
Hmm... I give you an 'F'.  F for FLEE FOR YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE!
Aw, don't feel bad.  Last week's dinner got that one wrong, too!
Correct!  For your next question... nope, sorry, that was a lie.  You were wrong.  Now I'm going to devour you.

You are stupid like an animal.  And soon, you will die like one.
Ignorant brute.  I will take great pleasure in removing you from the gene pool.
